                        critical thinking and inquiry-based exploration in the classroom. Furthermore, my experience with educational technology
                        allows me to integrate interactive tools and resources to enhance the learning experience and facilitate student engagement. Overall, 
                        I am dedicated to creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment where every student can reach their full potential.
